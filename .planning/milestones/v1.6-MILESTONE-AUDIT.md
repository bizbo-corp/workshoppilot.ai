# v1.6 Production Polish — Milestone Audit

**Audited:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** gaps_found
**Score:** 10/13 requirements satisfied

## Milestone Definition of Done

> Make WorkshopPilot.ai production-ready with working auth, Google OAuth, first-run onboarding, and visual polish across all surfaces.

## Phase Summary

| Phase | Name | Status | Verification | Score |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 40 | Production Auth | Complete | passed | 4/4 criteria |
| 41 | User Onboarding | **Not Started** | **MISSING** | 0/3 criteria |
| 42 | Visual Polish | Complete | passed | 14/14 criteria |

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

| REQ-ID | Description | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| AUTH-01 | Sign-in button visible and functional | SATISFIED | 40-01 provides | [x] | **satisfied** |
| AUTH-02 | Clerk configured for workshoppilot.ai | SATISFIED | 40-01 provides | [x] | **satisfied** |
| AUTH-03 | Google OAuth one-click sign-in | SATISFIED (gap resolved) | 40-02 provides | [x] | **satisfied** |
| AUTH-04 | Sign-up/sign-in flows work on production | SATISFIED (human verified) | 40-01, 40-02 provides | [x] | **satisfied** |
| ONBD-01 | First-time welcome tour | **MISSING** | **MISSING** | [ ] | **unsatisfied** |
| ONBD-02 | Tour dismissible and persistent | **MISSING** | **MISSING** | [ ] | **unsatisfied** |
| ONBD-03 | Tour adapts to step context | **MISSING** | **MISSING** | [ ] | **unsatisfied** |
| VISL-01 | Olive theme gaps fixed | SATISFIED | 42-01 provides | [x] | **satisfied** |
| VISL-02 | Smooth step transitions | SATISFIED | 42-02 provides | [x] | **satisfied** |
| VISL-03 | Consistent hover/active states | SATISFIED | 42-03 provides | [x] | **satisfied** |
| VISL-04 | Loading skeletons | SATISFIED | 42-02 provides | [x] | **satisfied** |
| VISL-05 | Toast notifications | SATISFIED | 42-03 provides | [x] | **satisfied** |
| VISL-06 | Micro-interactions | SATISFIED | 42-03 provides | [x] | **satisfied** |

### Orphan Detection

ONBD-01, ONBD-02, ONBD-03 are present in REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table (mapped to Phase 41) but absent from ALL phase VERIFICATION.md files. Phase 41 directory does not exist. These are **orphaned requirements** — assigned but never executed or verified.

## Integration Report

### Cross-Phase Wiring (Phase 40 ↔ Phase 42)

| Connection | Status | Details |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Auth error toasts → Sonner olive theming | WIRED | Phase 40 `toast.error()` in sign-in-modal.tsx → Phase 42 olive CSS overrides in globals.css → `<Toaster>` in layout.tsx |
| ClerkProvider appearance → all auth modals | WIRED | layout.tsx appearance prop applies globally; no conflicting local overrides |
| Dashboard skeleton → auth loading | PARTIAL | AuthGuard uses inline `animate-pulse` spinner (not Phase 42 skeleton system) — cosmetic only |

### E2E Flow Traces

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Landing → Sign In → Dashboard | Ghost button → SignInModal → Clerk OAuth → redirect to /dashboard | COMPLETE |
| Unauthenticated /dashboard → Sign In | Proxy pass-through → DashboardUnauthenticated → AuthGuard → SignInModal | COMPLETE |
| Dashboard → Workshop → Step Navigation | Loading skeleton → workshop cards with hover → step transitions with fade | COMPLETE |
| Toast notifications across actions | 9 components → sonner toast → Toaster root → olive CSS theming | COMPLETE |

### Missing Phase 41 Integration Impact

The gap is **additive, not destructive**. No existing component imports, references, or conditionally branches on onboarding code. Phase 41's absence creates no broken imports, missing handlers, or degraded flows in Phases 40 and 42. First-time users land on the empty-state dashboard with "No workshops yet" CTA instead of receiving a guided tour.

## Tech Debt

### Phase 40: Production Auth
- TODO in `sign-up-modal.tsx`: Configure first name, last name as required fields in Clerk Dashboard
- ClerkProvider uses hardcoded `#6b7a2f` for colorPrimary (Clerk API requires hex values, not CSS variables) — slightly different shade than app olive tokens (`--olive-600: #768364`)
- AuthGuard loading state uses inline `animate-pulse` spinner instead of Phase 42 skeleton system

### Phase 42: Visual Polish
- 7 human verification items pending (transition feel, skeleton timing, toast olive theming, hover micro-interactions, sidebar hover states)
- Intentional `bg-blue-*` classes remain in sticky note color-picker UI (not a theme violation)

**Total: 5 tech debt items across 2 phases**

## Verdict

**Status: gaps_found** — 3 unsatisfied requirements (ONBD-01, ONBD-02, ONBD-03) from unstarted Phase 41. All executed phases (40, 42) pass verification with clean cross-phase integration and complete E2E flows. The milestone definition of done explicitly includes "first-run onboarding" which has not been delivered.
