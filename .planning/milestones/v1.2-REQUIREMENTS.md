## v1.2 Requirements (All Complete)

### Grid Canvas

- [x] **GRID-01**: User sees a swimlane grid on Step 6 canvas with 7 fixed rows and labeled column headers — Phase 21
- [x] **GRID-02**: User can drag post-it items and they snap to the nearest cell boundary on drop — Phase 21
- [x] **GRID-03**: Post-it items store cell assignment metadata (row + column) alongside pixel position — Phase 21
- [x] **GRID-04**: Grid overlay (lines, labels) stays aligned with canvas during pan and zoom — Phase 21
- [x] **GRID-05**: Target cell highlights visually (light blue) when user drags an item over it — Phase 21
- [x] **GRID-06**: Grid canvas state persists to database via existing auto-save infrastructure — Phase 21

### Dynamic Columns

- [x] **DCOL-01**: User can add stage columns via "+Add Stage" button with a name prompt — Phase 22
- [x] **DCOL-02**: User can remove stage columns with confirmation, migrating cards to adjacent column — Phase 22
- [x] **DCOL-03**: User can inline-edit column header labels — Phase 22

### AI Placement

- [x] **AIPL-01**: AI suggests content with specific cell placement via [GRID_ITEM] markup in chat responses — Phase 23
- [x] **AIPL-02**: Suggested items appear as preview nodes with "Add to Canvas" / "Skip" buttons — Phase 23
- [x] **AIPL-03**: Target cell pulses/highlights (yellow border) when AI suggests placement there — Phase 23
- [x] **AIPL-04**: User can accept (places permanent node) or reject (removes preview) each AI suggestion — Phase 23
- [x] **AIPL-05**: AI reads current grid canvas state (grouped by cell) as context for subsequent suggestions — Phase 23

### Output-to-Canvas Retrofit

- [x] **RETRO-01**: Step 2 structured output renders as organized canvas nodes on concentric rings by importance — Phase 24
- [x] **RETRO-02**: Step 4 structured output renders as organized canvas nodes in empathy map zones — Phase 24
- [x] **RETRO-03**: User can add, remove, and reorder cards within canvas sections after migration — Phase 24
- [x] **RETRO-04**: Canvas becomes the primary structured record; output panel replaced by canvas-only layout — Phase 24

**Coverage:** 17/17 requirements complete (100%)

## Requirement Notes

- **RETRO-01** adjusted: Originally "quadrants", implemented as "concentric rings" for more meaningful stakeholder importance visualization
- **RETRO-02** adjusted: Originally "empathy map quadrants", implemented as 6-zone layout (Says/Thinks/Feels/Does + Pains/Gains vertical strips)
- **RETRO-04** adjusted: Output panel fully replaced for Steps 2 & 4 (canvas-only), rather than mirroring — canvas is sole source of truth

## Future Requirements (Carried Forward)

These requirements were tracked during v1.2 but deferred to future milestones:

- CEXP-01 through CEXP-06: Canvas expansion features
- BPEX-01 through BPEX-03: Build Pack export features
