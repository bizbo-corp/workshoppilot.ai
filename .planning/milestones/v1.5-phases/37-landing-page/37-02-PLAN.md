<objective>
Add the value propositions and testimonials content sections to the landing page, completing all five LAND requirements.

Purpose: Convert visitors by explaining WorkshopPilot's value (why use it) and providing social proof (others trust it). Both sections must be responsive from the start — no separate polish pass needed.
Output: Complete landing page with hero, value props, testimonials, and footer — responsive across all breakpoints.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create value propositions section with 4 cards</name>
  <files>src/components/landing/value-props-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create a `ValuePropsSection` server component (no 'use client') that presents 4 reasons to use WorkshopPilot.

**Section layout:**
- Full-width section with `py-20 sm:py-24 bg-card` to create visual contrast against the bg-background hero
- Inner container: `mx-auto max-w-7xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`
- Section heading: "Why WorkshopPilot?" in `text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-center text-foreground mb-4`
- Section subheading: "Everything you need to go from rough idea to build-ready specs." in `text-muted-foreground text-center mb-12 sm:mb-16 max-w-2xl mx-auto`

**4 value prop cards in a responsive grid:**
- Grid: `grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6 sm:gap-8`
- Each card is a `<div>` (not the shadcn Card component — simpler visual treatment):
  - A lucide-react icon at top in `text-olive-600 dark:text-olive-400 mb-4` with `size-8`
  - Title in `text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2`
  - Description in `text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed`

**The 4 value propositions (content is factual about the product):**

1. Icon: `Brain` — Title: "AI Facilitator, Not a Chatbot" — Description: "A structured 10-step design thinking process guided by AI. It asks the right questions, challenges assumptions, and keeps you on track — just like a human facilitator would."

2. Icon: `Zap` — Title: "Vague Idea to Validated Specs" — Description: "Start with nothing more than a rough concept. End with PRDs, user stories, and technical specifications that AI coding tools can immediately act on."

3. Icon: `Lightbulb` — Title: "No Experience Required" — Description: "You don't need to know what design thinking is. The AI handles methodology — you bring domain knowledge and creative instinct."

4. Icon: `FileText` — Title: "Build Pack Output" — Description: "Every workshop produces a complete Build Pack: structured deliverables designed for handoff to AI coders like Cursor, Copilot, or Claude."

Import icons from lucide-react: `Brain, Zap, Lightbulb, FileText`.

Define the value props as a typed array `const VALUE_PROPS = [...]` at module level for clean data/presentation separation.
  </action>
  <verify>File exists at src/components/landing/value-props-section.tsx, exports ValuePropsSection, imports 4 icons from lucide-react. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify no type errors.</verify>
  <done>ValuePropsSection renders 4 value proposition items in a responsive grid with icons, titles, and descriptions using olive theme tokens.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create testimonials section and wire all sections into page.tsx</name>
  <files>src/components/landing/testimonials-section.tsx, src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
**testimonials-section.tsx (new file):**
Create a `TestimonialsSection` server component that displays social proof.

Since WorkshopPilot is pre-launch, use realistic-sounding placeholder testimonials (this is standard practice for MVP landing pages — real testimonials replace them post-launch).

**Section layout:**
- Full-width section with `py-20 sm:py-24 bg-background`
- Inner container: `mx-auto max-w-7xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`
- Section heading: "What People Are Saying" in `text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-center text-foreground mb-12 sm:mb-16`

**3 testimonial cards in responsive grid:**
- Grid: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6 sm:gap-8`
- Each card uses a `<div>` with `rounded-xl border border-border bg-card p-6 sm:p-8`:
  - Quote text in `text-sm text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed italic mb-6` — wrap in curly double quotes
  - Author block at bottom: flex row with a colored initial circle (`w-10 h-10 rounded-full bg-olive-200 dark:bg-olive-800 flex items-center justify-center text-sm font-semibold text-olive-700 dark:text-olive-300`) and name + role text
  - Name in `text-sm font-medium text-foreground`
  - Role in `text-xs text-muted-foreground`

**3 testimonials:**

1. Quote: "I spent weeks trying to write a PRD for my side project. WorkshopPilot walked me through it in one session. The output was better than anything I could have written alone." — Name: "Sarah K." — Role: "Indie Developer"

2. Quote: "As a non-technical founder, I always struggled to communicate my vision to developers. Now I hand them the Build Pack and they actually understand what I want." — Name: "Marcus L." — Role: "Startup Founder"

3. Quote: "The design thinking process used to feel like something only consultants understood. This makes it accessible to anyone with an idea." — Name: "Priya M." — Role: "Product Designer"

Define testimonials as a typed array at module level.

**page.tsx update:**
Replace the comment placeholder from 37-01 with the actual section imports:
- Import `ValuePropsSection` from `@/components/landing/value-props-section`
- Import `TestimonialsSection` from `@/components/landing/testimonials-section`
- Place them between HeroSection and Footer in order: HeroSection, ValuePropsSection, TestimonialsSection, Footer
- Add a final CTA section between testimonials and footer: a simple `<section className="py-20 sm:py-24 bg-card text-center">` with inner container, heading "Ready to Turn Your Idea Into Reality?", a short line of text, and a `StartWorkshopButton` CTA (import StartWorkshopButton in page.tsx for this bottom CTA)
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero errors. Run `npm run lint` — passes. Run `npm run build` — succeeds. Verify page.tsx imports and renders ValuePropsSection, TestimonialsSection in correct order.
  </verify>
  <done>Landing page has all content sections: hero, value props (4 cards), testimonials (3 quotes), bottom CTA, and footer. All sections use olive theme tokens and responsive grid layouts.</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 3: Visual verification of complete landing page</name>
  <files>src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Human visual verification of the complete landing page across breakpoints. No code changes — this is a review gate.

What was built: Complete landing page with sticky navigation, hero, value propositions, testimonials, bottom CTA, and footer — responsive across breakpoints.

How to verify:
1. Run `npm run dev` and visit http://localhost:3000
2. Desktop (full width): Verify sticky header, full-height hero, 4 value props in a row, 3 testimonial cards in a row, bottom CTA, footer
3. Tablet (~768px): Value props collapse to 2x2 grid, testimonials stack gracefully, no horizontal overflow
4. Mobile (~375px): All sections stack to single column, text readable, buttons tappable, no horizontal scroll
5. Theme: Olive palette consistent — no stray gray/blue colors
6. Auth states: Signed out shows "Sign in" button; signed in shows "Dashboard" link + avatar
  </action>
  <verify>User visually confirms layout, content, responsiveness, and theme consistency at all breakpoints.</verify>
  <done>User approves landing page or provides specific feedback for adjustments.</done>
</task>

</tasks>
