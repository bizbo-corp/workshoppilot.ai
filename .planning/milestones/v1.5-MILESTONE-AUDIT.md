# Milestone v1.5: Launch Ready — Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-19
**Status:** gaps_found
**Scores:** Requirements 13/15 | Phases 4/4 | Integration 11/12 | Flows 4/5

## Summary

All 4 phases (36-39) completed with verified SUMMARYs. Olive theme, landing page, and pricing page are fully functional. Phase 39 (Step 10 Outputs Shell) has a **render path gap**: the DeliverableCard components are correctly built and wired into SynthesisSummaryView, but the entire OutputPanel render chain was severed during Phase 31 (output panel retirement). No component in the app ever renders OutputAccordion, making the deliverable cards invisible to users.

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

| REQ-ID | Description | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | Traceability | Final Status |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------|--------------|

| OUT-03 | Synthesis summary retained | Phase 39: VERIFIED | (no field) | Complete | **partial** |
| OUT-04 | Extensible card layout | Phase 39: VERIFIED | (no field) | Complete | **satisfied** |

**Note:** SUMMARY frontmatter for all v1.5 phases lacks `requirements_completed` field — cross-reference relies on VERIFICATION.md (strong) + traceability table.

## Critical Gap: Step 10 Render Path

### The Problem

Phase 31 (v1.4) retired the output panel. The render chain was:

```
StepContainer → OutputAccordion → OutputPanel → SynthesisSummaryView → DeliverableCard
```

After Phase 31, `OutputAccordion` is exported but **never imported by any component**. The chain is severed:

```
StepContainer → ChatPanel + RightPanel (canvas only)
                ❌ OutputAccordion (orphaned — zero importers)
                    → OutputPanel
                        → SynthesisSummaryView
                            → DeliverableCard ← Phase 39 added here
```

### Impact

- **OUT-01**: DeliverableCard components exist (112 lines) but never render on screen
- **OUT-02**: Disabled buttons are correctly implemented but invisible
- **OUT-03**: Synthesis summary was already unreachable before Phase 39

### Root Cause

This is NOT a Phase 39 regression. Phase 39 correctly executed its plan (integrate into SynthesisSummaryView). The plan itself was based on a broken assumption — that SynthesisSummaryView renders to users. The output panel retirement in Phase 31 severed the render path, and no subsequent phase restored it for Step 10.

### Fix

Wire `SynthesisSummaryView` into the active render tree. Options:
1. Import and render `SynthesisSummaryView` directly in `step-container.tsx` for `stepOrder === 10` (bypassing the retired OutputAccordion)
2. Render it in `chat-panel.tsx` below the chat messages for Step 10
3. Render it in `right-panel.tsx` as an alternative to canvas for Step 10

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Score | Human Items |
|-------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 36: Olive Theme Rollout | human_needed | 4/4 | 4 dark mode interactive states |
| 37: Landing Page | human_needed | 5/5 | 6 responsive/auth layout checks |
| 38: Pricing Page | passed | 5/5 | 2 visual checks |
| 39: Step 10 Outputs Shell | human_needed | 5/5 | 3 visual/UX checks |

All phases pass automated verification. Human items are visual/interactive checks requiring a browser.

## Integration Check Results

**Connected:** 11/12 exports properly wired
**Orphaned:** OutputAccordion (never imported), getDeliverableIcon (unused export)
**PRICE-03 Warning:** Uncommitted working tree changes in `landing-header.tsx` add a /pricing nav link — would violate PRICE-03 if committed. Committed codebase is clean.

### E2E Flows

| Flow | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Landing → sign in → dashboard → workshop | ✓ Complete | Full journey works |
| Landing header reuse in pricing page | ✓ Complete | LandingHeader + Footer imported correctly |
| Olive theme across all surfaces | ✓ Complete | Zero bg-white/bg-gray/bg-blue in committed code |
| /pricing public access | ✓ Complete | Default-allow middleware, no auth redirect |
| Step 10 deliverable cards visible | ✗ Broken | Render path severed at OutputAccordion |

## Tech Debt

- `isPublicRoute` in proxy.ts defined but never used in middleware logic
- `getDeliverableIcon` exported but unused (synthesis-summary-view uses local map)
- Pre-existing `npm run build` failure in `/api/dev/seed-workshop`
- Semantic status colors (green/amber/red) in synthesis-summary-view outside olive token system

## Uncommitted Working Tree Changes

`src/components/layout/landing-header.tsx` has substantial uncommitted modifications:
- Adds `/pricing` to nav links (violates PRICE-03 if committed)
- Adds ThemeToggle component
- Adds mobile hamburger menu with Sheet drawer
- Adds `usePathname` for active link highlighting

These are outside the scope of any phase plan. Decision needed: commit as intentional enhancement, or revert.
