# Requirements: WorkshopPilot.ai

**Defined:** 2026-02-18
**Core Value:** Anyone with a vague idea can produce validated, AI-ready product specs without design thinking knowledge — the AI facilitator replaces the human facilitator.

## v1.5 Requirements

Requirements for v1.5 Launch Ready milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Theme & Design System

- [ ] **THEME-01**: All app surfaces (sidebar, header, chat panel, forms, dialogs) use existing olive palette from tailwind config/global.css consistently — "consultant authority" aesthetic
- [ ] **THEME-02**: Canvas/whiteboard backgrounds and post-it node colors follow the same olive-tinted palette in both light and dark modes
- [ ] **THEME-03**: All shadcn/ui components (buttons, inputs, cards, dialogs) are re-themed to match olive palette

### Landing Page

- [ ] **LAND-01**: Landing page has a hero section with headline, subheadline, and primary CTA (sign in / get started)
- [ ] **LAND-02**: Landing page has a "reasons to use" section with 3-4 value propositions
- [ ] **LAND-03**: Landing page has a testimonials section
- [ ] **LAND-04**: Landing page has a clear dashboard link / sign-in CTA in navigation
- [ ] **LAND-05**: Landing page is responsive (desktop + tablet + mobile)

### Pricing

- [x] **PRICE-01**: Pricing page exists with three tiers: Single Use, Facilitator, Annual Subscription
- [x] **PRICE-02**: Each tier shows name, price, feature list, and CTA button
- [x] **PRICE-03**: Pricing page is hidden from main navigation (accessible via direct URL only)
- [x] **PRICE-04**: Pricing content uses real suggested pricing and feature differentiation

### Outputs (Step 10)

- [x] **OUT-01**: Step 10 displays deliverable cards (PRD, Stakeholder PPT, User Stories, Tech Specs)
- [x] **OUT-02**: Each card shows deliverable name, description, and disabled download button with "Coming Soon" label
- [x] **OUT-03**: Step 10 retains existing synthesis summary alongside the deliverable cards
- [x] **OUT-04**: Deliverable card layout is extensible for future generation functionality

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Native mobile apps | Web-first, assess demand later |
| Offline mode | Significant architecture changes for minimal value |
| White-label solution | Premature before product-market fit |
| Video conferencing integration | Rely on external tools (Zoom, etc.) |
| Multi-language support | English first, internationalize later |
| Custom branding per organization | FFP at earliest |
| Pricing/billing integration | Pricing page is informational only; no payment processing in v1.5 |
| Step 10 actual file generation | Shell only in v1.5; generation deferred to MMP |
