## v1.0 Requirements

Requirements for MVP 1.0 — Working AI Facilitation. All 35 requirements shipped.

### Context Architecture

- [x] **CTX-01**: System stores structured JSON artifacts per step (HMW statement, stakeholder map, persona, etc.)
- [x] **CTX-02**: System generates conversation summaries when steps are completed
- [x] **CTX-03**: AI receives prior step artifacts + summaries as context when starting each step
- [x] **CTX-04**: System uses hierarchical context compression (short-term, long-term, persistent tiers)

### AI Facilitation Engine

- [x] **AIE-01**: Each step has a step-specific system prompt with context injection from prior steps
- [x] **AIE-02**: AI follows 6-phase conversational arc per step (Orient, Gather, Synthesize, Refine, Validate, Complete)
- [x] **AIE-03**: AI explains step purpose and references prior outputs when orienting user
- [x] **AIE-04**: AI validates step output against quality criteria before allowing progression
- [x] **AIE-05**: AI references prior step outputs by name in conversation

### Structured Outputs

- [x] **OUT-01**: Each step produces a typed JSON artifact matching a Zod schema
- [x] **OUT-02**: System extracts structured outputs from conversation using AI with retry logic
- [x] **OUT-03**: User sees extracted output and confirms before step is marked complete
- [x] **OUT-04**: Structured outputs render as formatted Markdown in the UI

### Navigation & Persistence

- [x] **NAV-01**: User can navigate back to any completed step and view its output
- [x] **NAV-02**: User can revise earlier steps; downstream steps marked as needing regeneration
- [x] **NAV-03**: System auto-saves conversation periodically and on step completion
- [x] **NAV-04**: User can resume a workshop from where they left off

### Steps 1-10

- [x] **S01-01**: AI guides user from vague idea to structured Challenge Statement
- [x] **S01-02**: System produces HMW statement with problem core, target user, and altitude check
- [x] **S02-01**: AI helps user brainstorm and categorize stakeholders
- [x] **S02-02**: System produces hierarchical stakeholder list with priorities (Core/Direct/Indirect)
- [x] **S03-01**: AI generates interview questions based on stakeholder map
- [x] **S03-02**: AI simulates stakeholder responses as synthetic interviews
- [x] **S03-03**: System produces research quotes and key insights
- [x] **S04-01**: AI clusters research quotes into themes
- [x] **S04-02**: System produces 5 top pains and 5 top gains with evidence
- [x] **S05-01**: AI synthesizes research into persona with name, role, bio, quote, pains, gains
- [x] **S05-02**: Persona pains/gains trace back to Step 4 research themes
- [x] **S06-01**: AI auto-generates journey map (4-8 stages x 5 layers) based on persona
- [x] **S06-02**: System identifies the dip (biggest pain point / opportunity area)
- [x] **S07-01**: AI suggests HMW statement components with options for each field
- [x] **S07-02**: System validates HMW alignment with challenge, persona, and journey dip
- [x] **S08-01**: AI facilitates text-based mind mapping with themes and ideas
- [x] **S08-02**: User can add their own ideas alongside AI suggestions
- [x] **S08-03**: AI facilitates brain writing (building on existing ideas)
- [x] **S09-01**: AI generates concept sheet with name, elevator pitch, and USP
- [x] **S09-02**: AI produces SWOT analysis and feasibility scores with rationale
- [x] **S10-01**: AI generates synthesis summary recapping the full 10-step journey
- [x] **S10-02**: Summary includes key outputs from each step

### Production Hardening

- [x] **PROD-01**: System implements rate limit handling with exponential backoff and user feedback
- [x] **PROD-02**: System implements database connection warming to prevent cold start delays
- [x] **PROD-03**: System handles streaming interruptions gracefully with reconnection
