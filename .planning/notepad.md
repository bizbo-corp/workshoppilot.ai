Now I need a feature to create an image of the person to make it feel real. Can we use the chacteristics of the persona Age, Name, Job, Pains, Gains, Quotes as a way to generate a perosona that will be good for the profile image.



Characteristics to create a good caricature might be

Super mum, busy, stressed. Phones, Swamped by kids stuff. 



How might we be able to eatract some goog details to pass onto an image generator and make this with the gemini api
