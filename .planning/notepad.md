Idea Selection



I need a simple selection feature for the crazy eight step so that once the drawings and descriptions are made then the user can choose the best ones to make into concepts, making it possible for one, two, or three to go forward. 



Concept development dialogue flow 

A matrix of two by two for the concept development, with ezydraw objects on each cell excluding the top left. The idea is that we take the chosen concepts or single concept from the previous step and iterate on them one by one. Allow the user to click on the top right quadrant to improve on the concept.
