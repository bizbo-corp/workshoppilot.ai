I need to make a new feature where the cost of AI tokens is being calculated during run time and tallied for the entire journey. I want this output in the admin toolbar for only the local version and only when the admin user is using it (i.e me). For instance check the cost of tokens for the models being used with the amount of tokens that are being sent to and from the LLM and recalculate this in the admin section of the footer. This also must be completed for image generation on things such as the Persona cards. Different functions and generations, whether it's text, dialogue, or image generation, will have different costs so that needs to be factored in. When an entire workshop has been completed I need a summary of the entire cost of that workshop for the admin user on the dashboard card. 





I need the functionality for the pointer tool to be available for any step that has canvas items, including the ideation steps and all of the steps with whiteboard sticky notes. I need the selection tool to be able to draw a square marquee over multiple items and move them together, whether that is canvas nodes or sticky nodes.
