## E2E Story Framework

### Visual Fixes



### General Dialog fixes









I have a new idea for a way for people to articulate themselves better through a storytelling framework.

Often I've had trouble articulating myself, whether it's a job interview or a business pitch or trying to influence someone to take action. If only I had a framework to articulate my ideas, I might be able to get my point across more effectively. 

How might we empower speakers to communicate their ideas more effectively to persuade, inspire, or drive others to action?
