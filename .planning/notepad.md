I need to make a new feature where the cost of AI tokens is being calculated during run time and tallied for the entire journey. I want this output in the admin toolbar for only the local version and only when the admin user is using it (i.e me). For instance check the cost of tokens for the models being used with the amount of tokens that are being sent to and from the LLM and recalculate this in the admin section of the footer. This also must be completed for image generation on things such as the Persona cards. Different functions and generations, whether it's text, dialogue, or image generation, will have different costs so that needs to be factored in. When an entire workshop has been completed I need a summary of the entire cost of that workshop for the admin user on the dashboard card. 





I need the functionality for the pointer tool to be available for any step that has canvas items, including the ideation steps and all of the steps with whiteboard sticky notes. I need the selection tool to be able to draw a square marquee over multiple items and move them together, whether that is canvas nodes or sticky nodes. 







I need to modify the ideation mind map step. When asking the chat to generate ideas, it seems to go with wild, far-fetched ideas. It seems like there are too numerous a number, with too many subcategories, to start with. 

 can we rein in the mind mapping ideation somewhat so that it starts off with a node for an idea that's directly related to solving the persona's challenge.  for instance if it's about structuring one's thoughts, you might come up with an app to provide a framework to organise complex topics into simple processes . that's just an example but to keep things grounded I think that we start there and then we might want to have a wild card that is slightly more extreme in idea.
