~~I want to implement streaming responses for my AI chat interface. Please update the backend to use Server-Sent Events (SSE) so the model's output is sent in chunks. On the frontend, ensure the UI updates reactively as each chunk arrives to create a natural 'typewriter' feel.~~

~~Chat window always scrolls to the bottom~~

~~Remove duplicate intro when reloading the step.~~ 

~~What does the revise step do? Can it be used to eliminate the chat record all the way back to the start of the current step (and anything forward)? ~~

~~Is the bug icon still rellevant? Does it just show/hide the output panel for some steps (not all of)~~

Add to whiteboard finessing.

Work on whiteboard first (Stakeholders)

~~Chat window is 320px (adjustable), whiteboard takes the remaining space. ~~
