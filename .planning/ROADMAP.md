### 🚧 v1.5 Launch Ready (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Make WorkshopPilot.ai presentable to the public — cohesive visual identity, a landing page that converts, a pricing page that sets expectations, and a Step 10 output shell that teases the Build Pack without promising it.

#### Phase 36: Olive Theme Rollout ✓

**Goal:** Every surface of the app reads as a single coherent product with the "consultant authority" aesthetic the olive palette was designed for.
**Completed:** 2026-02-18
**Plans:** 4/4 complete

Plans:
- [x] 36-01-PLAN.md — App surfaces: header, auth modals, dashboard, admin page, workshop card
- [x] 36-02-PLAN.md — Canvas surfaces: toolbars, post-it nodes, overlays, context menus, concept cards
- [x] 36-03-PLAN.md — EzyDraw theming, workshop features (idea selection, concept sheet, HMW), remaining canvas nodes
- [x] 36-04-PLAN.md — Gap closure: replace bg-white/N alpha variants in 4 canvas node files

#### Phase 37: Landing Page ✓

**Goal:** A visitor arriving at workshoppilot.ai understands what it does, why it matters, and has a clear path to sign in and start a workshop.
**Completed:** 2026-02-19
**Plans:** 2/2 complete

Plans:
- [x] 37-01-PLAN.md — Page scaffold, enhanced hero section, sticky navigation, footer
- [x] 37-02-PLAN.md — Value propositions section, testimonials section, responsive polish, visual verification

#### Phase 38: Pricing Page ✓

**Goal:** Real pricing information is accessible via direct URL for anyone who needs it, without cluttering the main navigation or implying payment processing exists.
**Depends on:** Phase 36 (theme established)
**Requirements:** PRICE-01, PRICE-02, PRICE-03, PRICE-04
**Completed:** 2026-02-19
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 38-01-PLAN.md — Pricing page route with three-tier layout, public route access, olive theme

#### Phase 39: Step 10 Outputs Shell

**Goal:** Users who complete a workshop see a tangible preview of what they'll be able to export — without any false promises of functionality that doesn't exist yet.
**Depends on:** Phase 36 (theme established)
**Requirements:** OUT-01, OUT-02, OUT-03, OUT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Step 10 shows deliverable cards for PRD, Stakeholder PPT, User Stories, and Tech Specs alongside the existing synthesis summary
  2. Each card displays the deliverable name, a description of what it contains, and a visibly disabled download button labeled "Coming Soon"
  3. The existing AI synthesis summary from Step 10 remains visible and is not displaced by the new cards
  4. The card layout is clearly structured for extension — adding real generation later requires adding functionality to existing cards, not restructuring the layout
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 39-01-PLAN.md — DeliverableCard component + SynthesisSummaryView integration with 4 Build Pack preview cards
