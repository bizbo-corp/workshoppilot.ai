# Landing Page Optimisation

> To make a $99+ price point feel like a "steal," move the conversation away from "AI generation" and toward **"Weeks of work saved."** If a founder hired a Design Thinking consultant or a Product Manager to create these documents, it would cost thousands. Copy and deliverables need to reflect that professional standard.

---

## 1. High-Conversion Landing Page Copy

The goal: emphasise the **outcome**, not the process.

**Headline:**
> Go from "Vague Idea" to "Developer-Ready" in 60 Minutes.

**Sub-headline:**
> Stop guessing and start building. WorkshopPilot.ai uses proven Design Thinking frameworks to turn your vision into a comprehensive Build Pack — the exact blueprint you need to hire devs or start coding today.

### The "Why Now" Section

- **Kill the Blank Page** — No more staring at a cursor wondering what feature comes first.
- **Avoid Costly Rebuilds** — 70% of software waste comes from poor requirements. We lock yours down before you spend a dime on dev.
- **Founder-to-Founder Clarity** — Get the artifacts you need to pitch partners or investors with confidence.

## 2. The "Build Pack" Deliverables

To justify the price, the Build Pack shouldn't just be a PDF of the chat. It should be a zip file or structured dashboard containing these specific, high-value assets:

| Deliverable               | What it is                                    | Why it's worth $$$                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The PRD                   | A formal Product Requirements Document.       | This is the "Bible" for developers. It prevents scope creep. |
| User Stories              | A CSV/JSON export ready for Jira or Trello.   | Saves the founder 10+ hours of manual data entry.            |
| The Lean Canvas           | A 1-page business model breakdown.            | Essential for internal alignment and early pitching.         |
| Technical Roadmap         | A Phase 1 vs. Phase 2 feature prioritisation. | Helps the user launch an MVP instead of a "bloated" failure. |
| Interactive Prototype Map | A logic flow of how screens connect.          | Gives the UI/UX designer a massive head start.               |

## 3. The "Sneak Peek" Strategy

For the hybrid paywall — a "Paywall Screen" that appears after the free intro steps.

### Paywall Copy

> "Your Workshop is 80% complete. Our AI has processed your unique edge and identified your core user personas. To generate your final Build Pack — including the PRD, User Stories, and Technical Roadmap — unlock the full pilot."

**Visual Cue:** Show a "Glimpse" of their specific data (e.g., *"We've identified 3 key personas for [User's App Name]. Unlock to see their full journey maps."*)

## 4. Refining the Economics

If token cost is ~$10, aim for a **$99 price point**. This gives a 90% gross margin, which covers hosting, marketing, and the "free" tokens used by people who bounce before paying.

### The "Serial Entrepreneur" Upsell

On the checkout page, offer a one-time deal:

| Option         | Price | Note                                                      |
| -------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 Workshop     | $99   | Standard                                                  |
| 3 Workshops    | $199  | Saves $100 — perfect for the founder whose first idea might pivot |
