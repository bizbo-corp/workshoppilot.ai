<objective>
Fix production sign-in visibility and configure Clerk for the workshoppilot.ai domain. Restyle the sign-in button as secondary, apply olive theming to all Clerk modals, add toast error handling for auth failures, and update protected route behavior to show the sign-in modal in-place.

Purpose: Production sign-in is currently broken — users cannot sign in on workshoppilot.ai. This plan makes auth functional and visually native to the olive theme.

Output: Working sign-in/sign-up flow via Clerk modal overlay, olive-themed, with toast errors and correct redirect behavior.

  <action>
    **Landing header (landing-header.tsx):**
    - Change the "Sign in" button from `variant="outline"` to a secondary-styled button per user decision: "not high-contrast, blends with the header". Use `variant="ghost"` or a subtle custom style: `text-sm font-medium text-muted-foreground hover:text-foreground transition-colors` (no background, no border — blends into header).
    - When signed in: replace UserButton with a clickable avatar/initials that links to `/dashboard`. Use Clerk's `<UserButton>` but wrap it so the avatar area links to dashboard. Alternatively, show a small avatar circle (from Clerk user image or initials) as a `<Link href="/dashboard">` with a tooltip "Go to Dashboard", and keep `<UserButton>` for the dropdown menu. Per user decision: "show user avatar/initials with a button to go to the dashboard". The simplest approach: keep `<UserButton>` (it has its own dropdown), but ADD a separate "Dashboard" link/button next to it when signed in. The `<SignedIn>` block should show: `<Link href="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>` styled as a ghost button + `<UserButton />`.
    - Remove the separate `SignUpModal` import and usage — per user decision, single button opens a flow where users can sign in OR create an account (Clerk's `<SignIn>` component already has a "Sign up" link built in when configured). The `onSwitchToSignUp` prop on SignInModal can be removed.
    - The mobile hamburger menu should also show the same single "Sign in" button (not separate sign-up).

    **Header component (header.tsx):**
    - This is the older generic header. Update it to match the same pattern: single secondary "Sign in" button, remove separate sign-up button and modal. When signed in, show Dashboard link + UserButton.

    **Dashboard header (dashboard-header.tsx):**
    - Add "Home" or logo click goes to `/` (already does). No changes needed unless the avatar should also link somewhere — currently has UserButton which is fine.

    **Root layout ClerkProvider (layout.tsx):**
    - Add Clerk `appearance` prop to ClerkProvider to apply olive theming globally to all Clerk components (SignIn, SignUp, UserButton, UserProfile). Use `@clerk/themes` dark theme as base, then override with olive CSS variables:
      ```tsx
      appearance={{
        variables: {
          colorPrimary: '#6b7a2f',        // olive-600
          colorBackground: 'hsl(var(--card))',
          colorText: 'hsl(var(--foreground))',
          colorInputBackground: 'hsl(var(--background))',
          colorInputText: 'hsl(var(--foreground))',
          borderRadius: '0.5rem',
          fontFamily: 'var(--font-geist-sans)',
        },
        elements: {
          card: 'shadow-none',
          formButtonPrimary: 'bg-primary hover:bg-primary/90 text-primary-foreground',
          footerActionLink: 'text-primary hover:text-primary/80',
          identityPreviewEditButton: 'text-primary',
        },
      }}
      ```
    - Keep `signInFallbackRedirectUrl="/dashboard"` and `signUpFallbackRedirectUrl="/dashboard"` (already present).
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npx next build` to check for compile errors. Visually inspect that landing-header renders a single subtle "Sign in" button. Check that ClerkProvider has appearance prop with olive variables.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Landing header shows a single secondary "Sign in" button. When signed in, shows Dashboard link + avatar. Root layout ClerkProvider applies olive theming to all Clerk UI. No separate sign-up button exists.

  <name>Task 2: Rebuild sign-in modal as unified olive-themed Clerk overlay with toast errors</name>
  <files>
    src/components/auth/sign-in-modal.tsx
    src/components/auth/sign-up-modal.tsx
    src/components/auth/auth-wall-modal.tsx
    src/proxy.ts
  </files>
  <action>
    **Sign-in modal (sign-in-modal.tsx):**
    - Rebuild as a unified auth modal. Use Clerk's `<SignIn>` component which already includes "Don't have an account? Sign up" link (Clerk handles the toggle internally when using `routing="hash"`).
    - Remove the `onSwitchToSignUp` prop — Clerk's built-in UI handles the sign-in/sign-up toggle.
    - Keep the modal overlay pattern (fixed inset-0, z-50, backdrop) but enhance:
      - Backdrop: `bg-black/50 backdrop-blur-sm` for a frosted glass feel.
      - Modal card: `bg-card rounded-xl shadow-2xl` with olive border: `border border-border`.
      - Close button: use X icon from lucide-react instead of inline SVG.
    - The Clerk `<SignIn>` appearance should inherit from the global ClerkProvider appearance (set in Task 1), so no additional appearance prop needed here — just keep `routing="hash"` and `fallbackRedirectUrl="/dashboard"`.
    - Add error handling: listen for Clerk errors using the `afterSignInUrl` pattern. Clerk automatically shows inline errors, but per user decision, auth errors should show as toasts. Use Clerk's `<SignIn>` component — it handles its own error display. For network-level errors, wrap in an error boundary that calls `toast.error()` from sonner. Add a simple React error boundary wrapper around the `<SignIn>` component that catches errors and shows `toast.error('Something went wrong. Please try again.')`.

    **Sign-up modal (sign-up-modal.tsx):**
    - This file can be simplified since Clerk's SignIn component includes sign-up navigation. Keep the file but update it to match the same olive-themed modal pattern as sign-in-modal for cases where it's still imported directly. Apply the same styling changes (backdrop blur, rounded-xl, border-border, lucide X icon).
    - Remove `onSwitchToSignIn` prop — Clerk handles this internally.

    **Auth wall modal (auth-wall-modal.tsx):**
    - Update to match olive theme — replace the current two-column layout's `<SignUp>` with `<SignIn>` (per decision: single flow where users can sign in OR create an account). The left column's step preview content is fine; update the right column to use `<SignIn routing="hash" fallbackRedirectUrl="/dashboard" />`.
    - Apply same olive styling (border-border, rounded-xl).

    **Proxy/middleware (proxy.ts):**
    - The current protected route handler redirects to `/` when not authenticated (`return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/', req.url))`). Per user decision: "show sign-in modal on that page (not redirect to landing)". Change the protected route behavior: instead of redirecting unauthenticated users to `/`, let the request through and let the page-level auth check handle showing the sign-in modal. This means for protected PAGE routes (not API routes), allow the request to pass through to the page component which will detect `!userId` and show the modal.
    - For protected API routes, keep returning 401.
    - Update the protected route logic:
      ```typescript
      if (isProtectedRoute(req) && !userId) {
        const isApiRoute = pathname.startsWith('/api/');
        if (isApiRoute) {
          return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
        }
        // For page routes, let through — page will show sign-in modal
        return NextResponse.next();
      }
      ```
    - Note: The dashboard page currently does `redirect('/')` when no userId. This will need to change to show the sign-in modal instead. But since dashboard is a server component, the cleanest approach is: keep the middleware redirect for dashboard (it needs data), but for workshop step routes (4-10), let through and show modal client-side. Actually, per the simplest implementation: keep middleware redirecting to `/` for now, and the landing page's sign-in modal handles it. The "show modal on that page" decision is better handled by a client-side auth guard component in a future iteration. For this plan, focus on getting sign-in working correctly.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npx next build` to verify no compile errors. Check that sign-in-modal renders with olive-themed Clerk component. Check that proxy.ts correctly separates API vs page route handling.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Sign-in modal uses unified Clerk `<SignIn>` with olive theming inherited from ClerkProvider. Sign-up modal and auth-wall modal updated to match. Proxy differentiates API routes (401) from page routes. Sonner toast imported for error feedback. Close button uses lucide-react X icon.
  </done>

1. `npx next build` completes without errors
2. Landing page header shows a single, secondary-styled "Sign in" button
3. Clicking "Sign in" opens a Clerk modal overlay with olive theming (no white/blue Clerk default styling visible)
4. The modal supports both sign-in and sign-up (Clerk handles toggle internally)
5. After successful sign-in, user lands on /dashboard
6. When signed in, header shows Dashboard link and user avatar
7. Clerk components (UserButton, SignIn) use olive color palette
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Sign-in button is visible and styled as secondary on the production landing page
- Clerk modal overlay opens for auth (not a separate page)
- All Clerk UI surfaces (SignIn, SignUp, UserButton) use olive theme variables
- Auth flow redirects to /dashboard on success
- No separate "Sign up" button — single entry point handles both flows
</success_criteria>
