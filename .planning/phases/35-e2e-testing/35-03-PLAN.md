<objective>
Produce the final test report artifact documenting: what was tested, what passed, what was fixed inline, what is deferred to future phases, and an overall demo-readiness assessment.

Purpose: Provides a clear record of the E2E testing pass for the user to review and reference.
Output: 35-TEST-REPORT.md summarizing all testing outcomes.

    Create the test report by:

    1. Run `npm run test:e2e` one final time to capture clean results
    2. Read Playwright's JSON or text output to get pass/fail status per test
    3. Compile the report in the following structure:

    ```markdown
    # E2E Test Report — Phase 35

    **Date:** [date]
    **Milestone:** v1.4 Personal Workshop Polish
    **Test Environment:** localhost:3000, Chromium desktop, real Gemini API
    **Auth:** Clerk middleware bypassed via BYPASS_AUTH=true

    ## Summary

    | Metric | Value |
    |--------|-------|
    | Total tests | N |
    | Passed | N |
    | Failed | N |
    | Skipped | N |
    | Duration | Xm Xs |

    ## Test Results

    ### Workshop Walkthrough (workshop-walkthrough.spec.ts)

    | Test | Status | Duration | Notes |
    |------|--------|----------|-------|
    | Create workshop | PASS/FAIL | Xs | |
    | Step 1: Challenge | PASS/FAIL | Xs | |
    | Step 2: Stakeholder Mapping | PASS/FAIL | Xs | |
    | ... | | | |
    | Step 10: Validate | PASS/FAIL | Xs | |

    ## Bugs Fixed Inline

    | Bug | Step | Fix | Commit |
    |-----|------|-----|--------|
    | [description] | [step N] | [what was done] | [hash] |

    ## Issues Deferred

    | Issue | Severity | Reason | Target |
    |-------|----------|--------|--------|
    | [description] | [low/medium/high] | [why deferred] | [next milestone] |

    ## Demo Readiness Assessment

    [Overall assessment: Is the app demo-ready? What works well? What to avoid showing?]

    ## Coverage Notes

    - **Tested:** Happy path, forward progression, all 10 steps, real AI responses
    - **Not tested (deferred):** Back-revise navigation, mobile viewport, mocked AI, CI integration
    - **Canvas validation:** [What was/wasn't verified about canvas state]
    - **Context compression:** [Whether context quality was observed to degrade across steps]
    ```

    4. The report should be honest and specific:
       - If all tests pass, say so and note any close calls (flaky tests, slow responses)
       - If some tests fail, document exactly what failed and why
       - Include the actual Playwright test duration for each step
       - Note any AI response quality observations (e.g., "Step 7 HMW reframe was well-formed", "Step 10 response was generic")
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `cat .planning/phases/35-e2e-testing/35-TEST-REPORT.md` exists with populated tables
    - Report includes results for all 10 steps
    - Report includes demo readiness assessment
