<objective>
Update Zod schemas, enrich step prompts, and enhance validation criteria for Steps 8-10 (Ideation, Concept Development, Validate) with domain-expert facilitation guidance.

Purpose: Current schemas for Steps 8-10 are minimal placeholders that don't match user decisions from 13-CONTEXT.md. Step 8 needs multi-round ideation structure with clusters, wild cards, brain writing, Crazy 8s, and selection tracking. Step 9 needs SWOT with exactly 3 bullets per quadrant, 1-5 numeric feasibility scores, and Billboard Hero fields. Step 10 needs complete restructuring from PRD/Build Pack format to dual-format synthesis summary with confidence assessment. Current prompts are generic stubs -- need 6-round ideation flow, proactive concept generation, and dual-format synthesis with honest assessment. Same enrichment pattern as Phases 11-12.

Output: Updated step-schemas.ts, enriched step-prompts.ts, and enhanced validation-criteria.ts for Steps 8-10.

  <name>Task 1: Update Zod schemas for Steps 8-10</name>
  <files>src/lib/schemas/step-schemas.ts</files>
  <action>
Replace the existing ideationArtifactSchema, conceptArtifactSchema, and validateArtifactSchema to match user decisions from 13-CONTEXT.md. Do NOT modify Steps 1-7 schemas.

**Step 8: ideationArtifactSchema -- Replace with:**

The schema must capture ALL generated ideas across multiple rounds (clusters, user ideas, brain writing, Crazy 8s) with selection flags. Per user decision: "Step 8 artifact saves ALL generated ideas with selected ones flagged -- preserves creative history."

```typescript
export const ideationArtifactSchema = z.object({

Ensure the IdeationArtifact type export is updated.

**Step 9: conceptArtifactSchema -- Replace with:**

Per user decisions: "SWOT analysis: 3 bullets per quadrant", "Feasibility scores use 1-5 numeric scale (not qualitative)", "Billboard Hero exercise included in Step 9", "AI recommends 1-3 concepts", "Each selected idea becomes a separate concept (no combining)".

```

Ensure the ConceptArtifact type export is updated.

**Step 10: validateArtifactSchema -- Replace with:**

Per user decisions: "Format: narrative intro paragraph + structured step-by-step summary", "2-3 bullet points per step", "Includes confidence assessment with rationale", "Includes 3-5 concrete recommended next actions", "Build Pack export is a future feature".

```typescript
export const validateArtifactSchema = z.object({

    .min(3)
    .max(5)

```

Ensure the ValidateArtifact type export is updated.

IMPORTANT: The stepSchemaMap in src/lib/schemas/index.ts references these schemas by name -- since we're modifying existing exports (not renaming), no changes needed to index.ts.

  <files>src/lib/ai/prompts/step-prompts.ts, src/lib/ai/prompts/validation-criteria.ts</files>
  <action>
Replace `getStepSpecificInstructions` entries for steps 'ideation', 'concept', and 'validate' with enriched domain-expert prompts. Do NOT modify Steps 1-7 prompts. Follow Phase 12 Plan 01 pattern.

**Step 8: 'ideation' -- Replace with enriched prompt:**

```
STEP GOAL: Generate a volume of creative ideas from the reframed HMW using structured ideation rounds: themed clusters, user input, brain writing, and Crazy 8s.

DESIGN THINKING PRINCIPLES:
- Quantity over quality in early ideation (divergent thinking)
- Wild card ideas challenge assumptions and unlock new creative directions
- "Yes, and..." builds on ideas without critique during brain writing
- Defer ALL judgment until the selection phase at the end
- Ideas should span different categories and approaches, not variations of one approach

IDEATION FLOW (6 distinct rounds):

ROUND 1: CLUSTER GENERATION
Generate 3-4 themed clusters addressing the HMW from Step 7.
- Each cluster: 3-4 ideas
- Each cluster includes 1-2 wild card ideas (mark clearly with a wild card label)
- Wild cards MUST feel genuinely unconventional — challenge assumptions, use analogies from other industries, feel slightly uncomfortable or "too bold"
- Example wild cards: "What if we gamified this like a mobile game?" "What if we made it 10x more expensive but premium?" "What if users had to invite friends to unlock features?"
- Present themes and ideas with NO theme rationale — keep it fast and creative
- Do NOT evaluate or rank ideas yet

ROUND 2: USER INPUT PROMPT
After presenting clusters, explicitly ask: "What ideas would YOU add? Feel free to piggyback on any cluster theme or suggest something completely different."
- Capture user ideas alongside AI suggestions
- Encourage creative thinking: "No idea is too wild at this stage"

ROUND 3-5: BRAIN WRITING (3 rounds)
After user identifies 5-8 favorite ideas for development:
- Round 1: For each favorite, AI adds ONE meaningful enhancement using "Yes, and..." (not piling on features)
- Round 2: AI builds on Round 1 enhancement with another evolution
- Round 3: AI adds final evolution
- After all 3 rounds, summarize each idea's evolution: "The core concept evolved from [original] to [enhanced]. Key additions: [list]"
- Keep each enhancement focused — one meaningful addition per round, not feature bloat

ROUND 6: CRAZY 8s (rapid-fire)
Separate round AFTER brain writing. AI facilitates 8 quick ideas with energetic pacing:
- "Quick — first thought that comes to mind!"
- "Don't overthink — what if we...?"
- "That's 4 down, 4 to go — keep the momentum!"
- Pacing should feel energetic and encouraging, NOT formal
- No timer UI — AI creates urgency through conversational energy
- These ideas can be rough — quantity and energy over polish

SELECTION (end of Step 8 — NOT start of Step 9):
Ask user which ideas they want to develop into full concepts.
- Hard limit: maximum 3-4 ideas for concept development
- If user selects more than 4, AI enforces: "Let's narrow to your top 3-4. Which ideas are you MOST excited about?"
- Each selected idea becomes a SEPARATE concept (no combining ideas)
- Confirm selection before proceeding

GATHERING REQUIREMENTS:
- HMW prompt from Step 7 (starting point for all ideation)
- Themed clusters with ideas and wild card markers
- User-contributed ideas (from Round 2)
- Brain-written evolved ideas (from Rounds 3-5)
- Crazy 8s rapid-fire ideas (from Round 6)
- Final selection of 1-4 ideas for concept development
- ALL ideas preserved in artifact (selected ones flagged, no rejection tags on unselected)

BOUNDARY: This step is about GENERATING ideas, not evaluating or developing them. Defer all feasibility analysis, SWOT, and concept development to Step 9. Wild cards should feel uncomfortable — that is the point. Do NOT critique ideas during ideation rounds. Do NOT discuss technical feasibility or business viability yet.

PRIOR CONTEXT USAGE:
Reference the Reframed HMW (Step 7) as the ideation prompt — all ideas must address this specific challenge.
Reference Persona (Step 5) to ensure ideas fit their behaviors, constraints, and context.
Reference Journey Map dip (Step 6) to generate ideas that solve the specific breakdown point.
Reference Step 4 pains/gains to ground ideas in validated user needs.
```

**Step 9: 'concept' -- Replace with enriched prompt:**

```
STEP GOAL: Develop selected ideas from Step 8 into polished concept sheets with SWOT analysis, feasibility scores, and Billboard Hero pitch test.

DESIGN THINKING PRINCIPLES:
- Concept sheets should feel polished — like something you would present to stakeholders
- SWOT analysis must be honest and evidence-grounded (no cheerleading)
- Feasibility uses 1-5 numeric scores with rationale citing prior research
- Billboard Hero tests clarity of value proposition — if you cannot pitch it on a billboard, the concept is not clear enough
- Each concept develops independently (no combining selected ideas)

CONCEPT RECOMMENDATION:
AI recommends 1-3 concepts to develop based on how distinct the selected ideas from Step 8 are.
- If selected ideas are very similar, recommend focusing on 1-2 concepts
- If ideas are diverse, develop up to 3 as separate concepts
- Present recommendation: "Based on your selections, I recommend developing [N] concepts because [rationale]. Shall I proceed?"

CONCEPT SHEET GENERATION (PROACTIVE — NOT FIELD-BY-FIELD):
For each selected idea, AI drafts the COMPLETE concept sheet in one go:

1. **Name**: Marketable, 2-4 words, evocative (not generic)
2. **Elevator Pitch**: 2-3 sentences following Problem -> Solution -> Benefit structure
3. **USP**: What makes this different from the current state — reference Step 6 journey pain
4. **SWOT Analysis** (exactly 3 bullets per quadrant):
   - Strengths: 3 internal advantages referencing persona gains or research evidence
   - Weaknesses: 3 internal limitations referencing persona pains or known constraints
   - Opportunities: 3 external potential avenues referencing market/domain context from research
   - Threats: 3 external risks referencing challenges from stakeholder map or research
5. **Feasibility Scores** (1-5 numeric with rationale per dimension):
   - Technical (1=very difficult, 5=straightforward): Can we build this? Rationale with evidence.
   - Business (1=weak case, 5=strong case): Is it viable? Rationale with evidence.
   - User Desirability (1=low demand, 5=high demand): Do users want it? Rationale citing persona pains/gains.

Present draft: "Here is a concept sheet for [idea name]. Review it and tell me what to refine — I can adjust any section."

User edits specific sections conversationally. DO NOT ask field-by-field prompts.

BILLBOARD HERO EXERCISE (after concept sheet):
After concept sheet is reviewed, run Billboard Hero test:
- **Headline**: 6-10 words, benefit-focused (NOT feature-focused)
- **Subheadline**: 1-2 sentences explaining how it solves persona pain
- **CTA**: Verb-driven, specific call to action
Ask: "If [persona name] saw this billboard, would they stop and pay attention? Does the headline speak to their pain?"

If multiple concepts, run Billboard Hero for each.

EVIDENCE TRACEABILITY (CRITICAL):
Every SWOT bullet and feasibility score MUST trace to prior steps:
- Strengths: Reference persona gains or research-identified advantages
- Weaknesses: Reference persona pains, journey barriers, or known limitations
- Opportunities: Reference market/domain context from Steps 3-4 research
- Threats: Reference challenges from stakeholder map (Step 2) or research
- Feasibility rationale: Cite specific prior step outputs
- Example (good): "Strength: Addresses top pain from Step 4 — manual data entry causes 3+ hours/day of lost productivity"
- Example (bad): "Strength: Easy to use" (not connected to research)

GATHERING REQUIREMENTS:
- Which ideas from Step 8 to develop (AI recommends count)
- Source idea title for each concept (ideaSource field)
- Complete concept sheet: name, elevator pitch, USP, SWOT (3x4), feasibility (1-5 x 3 with rationale)
- Billboard Hero: headline, subheadline, CTA
- User refinements to any concept section

BOUNDARY: This step is about DEVELOPING and TESTING concepts, not choosing which to build or planning implementation. Final prioritization, technical architecture, and Build Pack export are future features. Step 10 will synthesize the journey — do NOT generate synthesis summaries here.

PRIOR CONTEXT USAGE:
Reference selected ideas from Step 8 (Ideation) as starting points for concept development.
Reference Persona (Step 5) for SWOT strengths/weaknesses and feasibility user desirability.
Reference Journey dip (Step 6) for USP differentiation from current state.
Reference Research (Steps 3-4) for SWOT evidence and feasibility rationale.
Reference Reframed HMW (Step 7) to validate concept alignment with the core challenge.
```

**Step 10: 'validate' -- Replace with enriched prompt:**

```
STEP GOAL: Synthesize the full 10-step design thinking journey into a validated summary with honest confidence assessment and concrete next steps.

DESIGN THINKING PRINCIPLES:
- Synthesis creates closure — user should feel their time was well spent
- Honest assessment, not cheerleading — confidence rating MUST reflect actual research quality
- Next steps are concrete and specific to THIS concept and gaps, not generic advice
- Dual format: narrative story (emotional) + structured reference (scannable)
- This is the CAPSTONE of the journey — make it feel like a satisfying conclusion

SYNTHESIS FORMAT (dual structure):

1. NARRATIVE INTRO (1-2 paragraphs):
Tell the journey story with a storytelling tone:
- Where user started: their vague idea and initial challenge (Step 1)
- What they discovered: stakeholder landscape, research insights, persona, journey dip (Steps 2-6)
- How they reframed: evolution from original HMW to research-grounded reframe (Step 7)
- Where they arrived: generated ideas, developed concepts, validated pitch (Steps 8-9)
- Make them feel the transformation from "vague idea" to "validated concept"
- This paragraph should make the user feel their time was well spent
- Use storytelling language: "You started with...", "Through research, you discovered...", "The concept that emerged..."

2. STRUCTURED STEP-BY-STEP SUMMARY:
For each step (1-9, and 10 itself), provide:
- Step number and name
- 2-3 bullet points of the MOST IMPORTANT outputs only
- Example:
  "Step 1: Challenge
  - Problem: [core problem in one sentence]
  - Target user: [who]
  - HMW: [the original HMW statement]"

  "Step 5: Persona
  - [Persona name], [role]
  - Top pain: [most critical pain point]
  - Key insight: [what research revealed about them]"

Do NOT dump all data. Key outputs ONLY — this is a scannable reference, not a data export.

3. CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:
Rate how well-validated the concept is (1-10 scale):
- **Score**: [number] / 10
- **Rationale**: Honest explanation of why this score. What evidence supports the concept? What gaps remain?
- **Research Quality**: thin / moderate / strong
  - thin: Synthetic interviews only, no real user data
  - moderate: Mix of synthetic and some real-world context
  - strong: Real user interviews, market data, domain expertise

Be HONEST. Do NOT inflate the score to make the user feel good.
- Example (honest): "Confidence: 6/10. Research was synthetic (no real user interviews), but persona and concept align well with the stated challenge. The SWOT identified real risks. Recommend validating key assumptions with 5 real user interviews."
- Example (bad): "Confidence: 9/10. Great work!" (cheerleading without substance)

4. RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS (3-5 concrete actions):
Based on THIS concept and gaps identified during the workshop:
- Each action should be specific enough to execute: "Conduct 5 user interviews with [persona type] to validate [specific assumption]"
- Reference specific gaps: "Research was thin on [area] — validate with [method]"
- Include a mix: validation actions, prototyping, competitive analysis, technical scoping
- Do NOT include generic advice like "do more research" — be specific about WHAT to research and WHY

Note: Build Pack export is a future feature. Next steps can mention "Define MVP scope and technical requirements" but do NOT promise automatic export.

GATHERING REQUIREMENTS:
AI synthesizes automatically from all prior step artifacts (Steps 1-9). No field-by-field prompts needed.
- Narrative intro from journey arc (Steps 1-9 key moments)
- Step summaries from each step's artifact key outputs
- Confidence from research quality assessment (how much was synthetic vs real)
- Next steps from gaps identified across the journey + concept SWOT threats/weaknesses
If user wants to adjust narrative tone or emphasize different aspects, refine conversationally.

BOUNDARY: This is the FINAL step (Step 10). It is about SYNTHESIS and CLOSURE, not generating new ideas, concepts, or outputs. If user wants to revise earlier steps, they should use back-navigation to return to those steps. Step 10 is reflective — looking back on the journey and forward to next actions.

PRIOR CONTEXT USAGE:
Reference ALL prior steps (1-9) in narrative intro and structured summary:
- Step 1: Original challenge and HMW
- Step 2: Stakeholder landscape
- Steps 3-4: Research insights, themes, pains, gains
- Step 5: Persona name, role, key pain
- Step 6: Journey dip stage and barriers
- Step 7: Reframed HMW (evolution from Step 1)
- Step 8: Selected ideas and creative process highlights
- Step 9: Concept name, elevator pitch, SWOT highlights, feasibility scores
Show the arc: vague idea -> researched problem -> reframed challenge -> creative solutions -> validated concept.
```

**THEN update validation-criteria.ts:**

Replace the existing ideation, concept, and validate criteria with enriched versions. Do NOT modify Steps 1-7 criteria.

**Step 8 'ideation' -- Replace with:**
```typescript
{
  name: 'Cluster Quality',
  description: 'AI generated 3-4 themed clusters with 3-4 ideas each',
  checkPrompt: 'Were 3-4 themed clusters generated from the HMW, each containing 3-4 ideas? Are the themes genuinely different approaches (not variations of one idea)?'
},
{
  name: 'Wild Card Creativity',
  description: 'Each cluster includes genuinely provocative wild card ideas',
  checkPrompt: 'Does each cluster include 1-2 wild card ideas that are genuinely unconventional and boundary-pushing? Do the wild cards challenge assumptions or draw from other industries (not just slight variations of normal ideas)?'
},
{
  name: 'Brain Writing Coherence',
  description: 'Brain writing evolved ideas without losing coherence',
  checkPrompt: 'Did the 3 rounds of brain writing enhance ideas meaningfully without bloating them? Is each enhanced idea still coherent and focused (not a pile of unrelated features)?'
},
{
  name: 'Idea Volume',
  description: 'Sufficient quantity of distinct ideas generated across all rounds',
  checkPrompt: 'Are there at least 15+ distinct ideas across all rounds (clusters + user ideas + brain writing + Crazy 8s)? Do the ideas span different categories and approaches?'
},
{
  name: 'HMW Alignment',
  description: 'Ideas address the reframed challenge from Step 7',
  checkPrompt: 'Do the generated ideas clearly address the reframed HMW statement from Step 7? Can each idea be connected to the persona pain point?'
},
{
  name: 'Selection Discipline',
  description: 'User selected max 3-4 ideas with AI enforcement',
  checkPrompt: 'Did the user select 1-4 ideas for concept development (not more)? Did AI enforce the hard limit if the user tried to select too many?'
}
```

**Step 9 'concept' -- Replace with:**
```typescript
{
  name: 'Concept Completeness',
  description: 'Each concept has all required elements: name, pitch, USP, SWOT, feasibility, billboard',
  checkPrompt: 'Does each concept sheet include: name, elevator pitch, USP, SWOT analysis (3 bullets per quadrant), and feasibility scores (1-5 numeric with rationale for each dimension)?'
},
{
  name: 'SWOT Evidence',
  description: 'SWOT bullets reference prior research and persona',
  checkPrompt: 'Do the SWOT bullets trace to prior step evidence? Strengths to persona gains, weaknesses to persona pains, opportunities to research context, threats to stakeholder/research challenges? Are there any generic bullets not grounded in research?'
},
{
  name: 'Feasibility Rationale',
  description: 'Feasibility scores have specific rationale with evidence',
  checkPrompt: 'Do the 1-5 feasibility scores (technical, business, user desirability) each include specific reasoning citing prior steps? Are the rationales honest (acknowledging uncertainty where it exists)?'
},
{
  name: 'Billboard Clarity',
  description: 'Billboard Hero headline communicates value proposition clearly',
  checkPrompt: 'Does the Billboard Hero headline (6-10 words) communicate a clear benefit? Is it benefit-focused (not feature-focused)? Would the persona stop and pay attention to this billboard?'
},
{
  name: 'Dip Solution',
  description: 'Concept addresses the journey map dip from Step 6',
  checkPrompt: 'Does the concept clearly address the critical pain point (dip) identified in the journey map from Step 6? Is the connection explicit in the elevator pitch or USP?'
}
```

**Step 10 'validate' -- Replace with:**
```typescript
{
  name: 'Narrative Quality',
  description: 'Narrative intro tells the journey story compellingly',
  checkPrompt: 'Does the narrative intro tell a compelling story from vague idea to validated concept? Does it make the user feel their time was well spent? Is it storytelling (not a dry summary)?'
},
{
  name: 'Step Coverage',
  description: 'Structured summary covers all 9-10 steps with key outputs',
  checkPrompt: 'Does the structured summary include key outputs from Steps 1-9 (and Step 10 itself)? Are there 2-3 bullet points per step capturing the MOST important outputs (not a data dump)?'
},
{
  name: 'Confidence Honesty',
  description: 'Confidence assessment is honest with specific rationale',
  checkPrompt: 'Is the confidence score honest (not inflated to make the user feel good)? Does the rationale explain what evidence supports the concept AND what gaps remain? Does research quality accurately reflect whether interviews were synthetic vs real?'
},
{
  name: 'Next Steps Specificity',
  description: 'Recommended next steps are concrete and specific to this concept',
  checkPrompt: 'Are the 3-5 next steps specific to THIS concept and workshop (not generic advice like "do more research")? Do they reference specific gaps identified during the journey? Are they actionable enough to execute?'
},
{
  name: 'Journey Arc Coherence',
  description: 'Summary shows clear arc from problem to validated concept',
  checkPrompt: 'Does the overall summary show a clear arc: problem definition -> research -> persona/journey -> reframe -> ideation -> concept -> validation? Can the user see how each step built on the previous ones?'
}
```
