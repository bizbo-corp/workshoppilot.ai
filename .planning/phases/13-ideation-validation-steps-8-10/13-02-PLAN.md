<objective>
Create step-specific UI components for Steps 8-10 (IdeationClusterView, ConceptSheetView, SynthesisSummaryView) and integrate them into the OutputPanel.

Purpose: Steps 8-10 need rich, structured rendering that matches the complexity of their artifacts. Generic markdown rendering cannot properly display clustered ideas with wild card badges, SWOT quadrant grids with feasibility bars, or dual-format synthesis summaries with confidence gauges. Same pattern as Phase 12 Plan 02 which created PersonaCard, JourneyMapGrid, and HMWBuilder for Steps 5-7.

Output: Three new components + updated OutputPanel with step-specific routing for Steps 8-10.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create IdeationClusterView and ConceptSheetView components</name>
  <files>src/components/workshop/ideation-cluster-view.tsx, src/components/workshop/concept-sheet-view.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create two new React components following the established pattern from Phase 12 (PersonaCard, JourneyMapGrid). Use 'use client' directive, Tailwind CSS, and the same prop pattern (accepting artifact as Record&lt;string, unknown&gt;).

**IdeationClusterView (`src/components/workshop/ideation-cluster-view.tsx`):**

Renders the Step 8 ideation artifact with these sections:

1. **HMW Prompt Banner**: Display the reframed HMW at the top as a subtle banner/quote block (sets context for all ideas below).

2. **Themed Clusters Section**: For each cluster in the `clusters` array:
   - Cluster theme as a section header with a subtle colored left border (use different colors per cluster for visual distinction)
   - Ideas as cards within each cluster
   - Wild card ideas get a distinct badge/marker (use amber/orange styling with a lightning bolt or sparkle icon text like "Wild Card") and slightly different card styling (dashed border or accent background)
   - Regular ideas have clean card styling

3. **User Ideas Section** (if `userIdeas` exists and has items):
   - Section header: "Your Ideas"
   - Same card styling as cluster ideas but with a distinct accent (user icon or "You" badge)

4. **Brain Writing Section** (if `brainWrittenIdeas` exists and has items):
   - Section header: "Brain Writing Evolution"
   - Each brain-written idea shows: original title -> evolution description -> final version
   - Use a subtle arrow or progression indicator showing the evolution flow
   - Consider a compact card with "Original:" and "Evolved:" labels

5. **Crazy 8s Section** (if `crazyEightsIdeas` exists and has items):
   - Section header: "Crazy 8s" with energetic styling (maybe a small "rapid-fire" badge)
   - Compact grid layout (2 columns) since these are quick rough ideas
   - Lighter styling than main cluster ideas (reflecting their rough nature)

6. **Selected Ideas Footer**: Highlight which ideas were selected for concept development:
   - Selected ideas get a checkmark badge and primary color highlight
   - Show as a compact list at the bottom: "Selected for Concept Development: [idea 1], [idea 2], [idea 3]"

Props: `artifact: Record&lt;string, unknown&gt;`

Parse the artifact by casting to expected shape. Handle missing optional fields gracefully (don't crash if brainWrittenIdeas or crazyEightsIdeas are undefined).

**ConceptSheetView (`src/components/workshop/concept-sheet-view.tsx`):**

Renders the Step 9 concept artifact with these sections (for each concept in the `concepts` array):

1. **Concept Header**: Concept name as a prominent heading with the source idea reference below it in muted text ("Developed from: [ideaSource]")

2. **Elevator Pitch**: Display as a prominent quote block or callout with slightly larger text

3. **USP**: Display as a highlighted badge or accent block ("What makes this different: ...")

4. **SWOT Grid**: Render as a 2x2 grid layout:
   - Top-left: Strengths (green accent) with numbered bullet list
   - Top-right: Weaknesses (red accent) with numbered bullet list
   - Bottom-left: Opportunities (blue accent) with numbered bullet list
   - Bottom-right: Threats (amber/orange accent) with numbered bullet list
   - Each quadrant has a colored header bar and 3 bullet items
   - Use bg-green-50/bg-red-50/bg-blue-50/bg-amber-50 for light backgrounds (dark mode: bg-green-950/etc)

5. **Feasibility Scores**: For each dimension (technical, business, userDesirability):
   - Label + score display (e.g., "Technical: 4/5")
   - Visual bar or dot indicator showing 1-5 score (filled vs empty dots, or a progress-bar style)
   - Rationale text below each score in muted/smaller text
   - Use semantic colors: green for 4-5, amber for 3, red for 1-2

6. **Billboard Hero Section** (if `billboardHero` exists):
   - Styled as a mock billboard card with centered text
   - Headline in large bold text
   - Subheadline in medium text below
   - CTA as a styled button-like element
   - Distinct visual treatment (maybe a dark card with light text, or a bordered card with different background)

7. **Concept Separator**: If multiple concepts exist, use a clear visual separator between them (horizontal rule or spacing)

Props: `artifact: Record&lt;string, unknown&gt;`

Parse the artifact by casting to expected shape. Handle single vs multiple concepts. Handle missing optional billboardHero gracefully.

IdeationClusterView renders clustered ideas with wild card badges, user ideas section, brain writing evolution, Crazy 8s grid, and selected idea highlights. ConceptSheetView renders polished concept sheets with 2x2 SWOT grid, 1-5 feasibility bars with rationale, and Billboard Hero mock billboard card.

  <name>Task 2: Create SynthesisSummaryView and integrate all three into OutputPanel</name>
  <files>src/components/workshop/synthesis-summary-view.tsx, src/components/workshop/output-panel.tsx</files>
  <action>
**SynthesisSummaryView (`src/components/workshop/synthesis-summary-view.tsx`):**

Renders the Step 10 validate artifact as a polished journey summary:

1. **Narrative Intro**: Display the narrative text in a prominent section:
   - Use slightly larger text or a serif-style class for storytelling feel
   - Give it breathing room (generous padding/margins)
   - Subtle accent background or left border to distinguish from structured content

2. **Step-by-Step Summary**: For each step in the `stepSummaries` array:
   - Compact layout: Step number badge + step name + bullet list of key outputs
   - Use numbered badges (1-10) with primary color
   - Key outputs as bullet points
   - Consider collapsible/expandable sections if space is tight, but start with all visible
   - Group visually: maybe a vertical timeline or numbered list with clear step boundaries

3. **Confidence Assessment**: Display prominently:
   - Score as a large number with "/10" suffix
   - Visual gauge or indicator (could be a simple colored bar: green for 7+, amber for 4-6, red for 1-3)
   - Research quality badge: "thin" (red), "moderate" (amber), "strong" (green)
   - Rationale text below the score

4. **Recommended Next Steps**: Display as a checklist-style list:
   - Each action as a numbered item with a checkbox-style icon (unchecked -- these are recommended, not completed)
   - Clean, scannable layout
   - Maybe a "What's Next" header with an arrow icon

Overall: The component should feel like a polished report/summary document. Use generous spacing and clear visual hierarchy. This is the capstone view -- it should feel satisfying and complete.

Props: `artifact: Record&lt;string, unknown&gt;`

**OutputPanel Integration (`src/components/workshop/output-panel.tsx`):**

Add imports for the three new components at the top of the file:
```typescript
import { IdeationClusterView } from './ideation-cluster-view';
import { ConceptSheetView } from './concept-sheet-view';
import { SynthesisSummaryView } from './synthesis-summary-view';
```

Add conditional rendering blocks for Steps 8-10 in the artifact display section (after the existing Step 7 block, before the default markdown rendering). Follow the exact same pattern used for Steps 5-7:

```typescript
if (stepOrder === 8 && artifact) {
  return (
    <div className="flex h-full flex-col overflow-y-auto p-6">
      <div className="mb-4">
        <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">{step.mockOutputType}</h3>
          <span className="rounded-md bg-green-500/10 px-2 py-0.5 text-xs text-green-700 dark:text-green-400">
            Extracted
          </span>
        </div>
        <p className="mt-1 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
          Review your extracted output below
        </p>
      </div>
      <IdeationClusterView artifact={artifact} />
    </div>
  );
}

if (stepOrder === 9 && artifact) {
  // Same wrapper pattern with ConceptSheetView
}

if (stepOrder === 10 && artifact) {
  // Same wrapper pattern with SynthesisSummaryView
}
```

After this change, ALL 10 steps have step-specific rendering:
- Steps 1-4: Generic markdown (from Phase 9)
- Step 5: PersonaCard (from Phase 12)
- Step 6: JourneyMapGrid (from Phase 12)
- Step 7: HMWBuilder (from Phase 12)
- Step 8: IdeationClusterView (this plan)
- Step 9: ConceptSheetView (this plan)
- Step 10: SynthesisSummaryView (this plan)

Ensure no regressions in Steps 1-7 rendering.
