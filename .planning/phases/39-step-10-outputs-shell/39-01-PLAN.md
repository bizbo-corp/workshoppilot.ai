<objective>
Create deliverable preview cards for Step 10 that show users what they'll be able to export (PRD, Stakeholder PPT, User Stories, Tech Specs) alongside the existing synthesis summary.

Purpose: Users who complete a workshop see tangible evidence of what their Build Pack will contain, setting expectations for future functionality without false promises. The "Coming Soon" buttons make it clear export isn't available yet.

Output: DeliverableCard component + updated SynthesisSummaryView with deliverable cards section below the existing synthesis content.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create DeliverableCard component and deliverable data</name>
  <files>src/components/workshop/deliverable-card.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create a new client component `DeliverableCard` that renders a single deliverable preview card.

**Component interface:**
```tsx
interface DeliverableCardProps {
  title: string;          // e.g. "Product Requirements Document"
  description: string;    // e.g. "Complete PRD with objectives, user personas, features..."
  icon: React.ReactNode;  // Lucide icon passed as JSX
  disabled?: boolean;     // When true (default), shows "Coming Soon" button
  onDownload?: () => void; // Future: callback when download is enabled
}
```

**Card structure (use shadcn Card components):**
- Import `Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent, CardFooter` from `@/components/ui/card`
- Import `Button` from `@/components/ui/button`
- Import `Download` from `lucide-react` for the download icon on the button
- Card uses `bg-card` (inherited from shadcn Card component default)
- CardHeader: icon (in a rounded `bg-primary/10 text-primary` circle, 40x40) + title + description
- CardFooter: A `Button` with `variant="outline"` that is `disabled` when `disabled` prop is true
  - When disabled: button text is "Coming Soon" with `Download` icon, opacity handled by shadcn disabled styles
  - When enabled (future): button text is "Download", calls `onDownload`
- Default `disabled` to `true` so cards are disabled out of the box

**Also export a `DELIVERABLES` constant array** at the top of the file with the 4 deliverables data:
```tsx
export const DELIVERABLES = [
  {
    id: 'prd',
    title: 'Product Requirements Document',
    description: 'Complete PRD with objectives, target users, core features, success metrics, and technical constraints — ready for development.',
    iconName: 'FileText' as const,
  },
  {
    id: 'stakeholder-ppt',
    title: 'Stakeholder Presentation',
    description: 'Executive summary deck covering the problem, research insights, proposed solution, and implementation roadmap.',
    iconName: 'Presentation' as const,
  },
  {
    id: 'user-stories',
    title: 'User Stories',
    description: 'Prioritized user stories with acceptance criteria, mapped to personas and journey stages from your research.',
    iconName: 'Users' as const,
  },
  {
    id: 'tech-specs',
    title: 'Technical Specifications',
    description: 'Architecture overview, API contracts, data models, and integration requirements derived from your concept.',
    iconName: 'Code' as const,
  },
];
```

Map `iconName` to actual Lucide icons inside the component file (import `FileText, Presentation, Users, Code` from lucide-react). Export a helper `getDeliverableIcon(iconName: string): React.ReactNode` or handle the mapping inline in SynthesisSummaryView.

Keep the component simple and presentational — no state, no side effects.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — no TypeScript errors. The file exports `DeliverableCard`, `DELIVERABLES`, and the icon helper.
  </verify>
  <done>DeliverableCard component exists with typed props, disabled download button, and a DELIVERABLES data array for the 4 Build Pack items.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Integrate deliverable cards into SynthesisSummaryView</name>
  <files>src/components/workshop/synthesis-summary-view.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update the existing `SynthesisSummaryView` component to render the deliverable cards section BELOW the existing synthesis content.

**Import:**
- Import `DeliverableCard` and `DELIVERABLES` from `./deliverable-card`
- Import the relevant Lucide icons (`FileText, Presentation, Users, Code`) from `lucide-react`

**Add a new section AFTER the "What's Next" (recommendedNextSteps) section** — this is the last existing section, so deliverable cards go at the very bottom of the `space-y-8` container:

```tsx
{/* Build Pack Deliverables */}
<div className="space-y-4">
  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Build Pack Deliverables</h3>
  <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
    Export-ready documents generated from your workshop. Available soon.
  </p>
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
    {DELIVERABLES.map((d) => (
      <DeliverableCard
        key={d.id}
        title={d.title}
        description={d.description}
        icon={/* map d.iconName to JSX icon */}
        disabled={true}
      />
    ))}
  </div>
</div>
```

**Key decisions:**
- The deliverable cards section renders UNCONDITIONALLY (not gated by artifact fields) — it always appears in Step 10 output, even in empty state, because it previews future capability
- But it should still be inside the main `space-y-8` container, below all existing sections
- The grid is 2 columns on sm+ screens, 1 column on mobile — 4 cards in a 2x2 grid
- The existing empty state check at the top of the component remains unchanged — deliverable cards only show when the synthesis summary has content (the artifact exists)
- Do NOT modify the empty state return — deliverable cards don't make sense without the synthesis content above them

**Do NOT:**
- Move or restructure any existing sections (narrative, step summaries, confidence, next steps)
- Change the component's props interface
- Add new props for deliverables (they're static data, not from the artifact)
- Touch `output-panel.tsx` or `step-container.tsx` — the integration point is solely within SynthesisSummaryView
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — no TypeScript errors. Run `npm run build` — build succeeds. Visually: navigate to Step 10 of a completed workshop — the synthesis summary shows all existing sections PLUS a "Build Pack Deliverables" grid of 4 cards at the bottom, each with a disabled "Coming Soon" button.
  </verify>
  <done>Step 10 synthesis view shows the existing narrative/summaries/confidence/next-steps PLUS a 2x2 grid of deliverable cards with disabled download buttons. No existing content displaced.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors
2. `npm run build` succeeds
3. Step 10 of a completed workshop shows: narrative intro, step summaries, confidence assessment, next steps, AND Build Pack deliverable cards
4. Each deliverable card shows: icon, title, description, disabled "Coming Soon" button
5. Existing synthesis content is unchanged and fully visible above the cards
6. Deliverable cards section uses the olive theme tokens via shadcn primitives (bg-card, text-foreground, etc.)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- 4 deliverable cards (PRD, Stakeholder PPT, User Stories, Tech Specs) visible in Step 10 output
- All cards have disabled download buttons labeled "Coming Soon"
- Existing synthesis summary (narrative, step-by-step, confidence, next steps) fully intact
- Layout is a clean grid that can be extended by changing `disabled` prop to `false` and wiring `onDownload`
- No TypeScript errors, build passes
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/39-step-10-outputs-shell/39-01-SUMMARY.md`
