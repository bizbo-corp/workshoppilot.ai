## Quick fixes

AI chat starts first message before user types at each step. Remove "Hello! Welcome to the Challenge step." as it is unnecessary.

## Nice to have

- Workshop title as edit-in-place title

## Personality

- LLM generated text is more concise
- Faciltator personality - fun, professional - User chooses facilitator style
- Emojis in and amongst text for more fun readability style
- Cut down intro text and overall length of AI responses. 

## Structured Inputs/Outputs

- UI in chat window e.g dropdown for HMW statement
- Generate image for persona

## Auto ask questions

- Buttons in chat e.g: 
    - What do you want to ask the Business Leader?

      [Walk me through the last time you tried to improve employee engagement. What happened?]

      [What's the most frustrating part of current solutions for improving employee engagement? Can you give me a specific example?]

      [If you could wave a magic wand and change one thing about employee engagement, what would it be and why?]
        - Made in relation to the challenge in the perspective of the stakeholder
        - 
        - 



Step e.g: Ideation starts with:

Time to get creative! We'll use multiple ideation techniques -- Mind Mapping, Crazy 8s, Brain Writing, and Billboard Hero -- to generate a wide range of solutions.

[I have to write something to see the next message like: "OK]

then I get:

Welcome to the Ideation phase! Now we get to explore potential solutions.

In this step, we'll use techniques like Mind Mapping, Crazy 8s, Brain Writing, and Billboard Hero to generate a wide range of ideas. The goal is to come up with as many possibilities as we can, focusing on quantity over quality at this stage. Don't worry about filtering or evaluating ideas just yet – that comes later. (blah blah blah)

[I'd rather it be like this.]

AI: In this Ideation phase, we'll use techniques like Mind Mapping, Crazy 8s, Brain Writing, and Billboard Hero to generate a wide range of ideas. The goal is to come up with as many possibilities as we can, focusing on quantity over quality at this stage. Don't worry about filtering or evaluating ideas just yet – that comes later.

AI: Let's first start brainstorming. What are some initial ideas that come to mind when you think about addressing this HMW statement? Don't hold back – any idea is a good idea at this point!
