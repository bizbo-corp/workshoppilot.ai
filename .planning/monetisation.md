Recommended Approach: The "Modified Pay-for-Results" (Hybrid)

Given your $10 token cost, Option 3 is dangerous (you'll lose money on every single-use customer), and Option 1 is a hard sell for a new tool.

I recommend a "Taste Test" Paywall. Here is how it works:

The Hook (Free): Let them run the first 2-3 steps of the Design Thinking process (e.g., Problem Definition and User Personas). This costs you cents, not dollars.

The Micro-Paywall: To proceed into the "Deep Work" (where the $10 token spend happens), they must purchase a Workshop Pass.

The Deliverable: The "Build Pack" is included in that pass.

Why this works: You demonstrate the AI's "intelligence" early on without burning your budget. By the time they hit the paywall, they've already invested 10 minutes of their own time—sunk cost bias makes them much more likely to pay.

Strategic Pricing Models for "One-Off" Services

Since users don't build apps every day, a monthly subscription is a tough sell. Consider these instead:

Here is the intended pricing:

The Single Flight ($49 - $99): One full workshop run + Build Pack. This covers your $10 cost and gives you a healthy margin.

The Serial Entrepreneur Pack ($149): 3 workshop credits that never expire. Perfect for people who "pivot" or have multiple ideas.

The Agency Tier: A monthly subscription specifically for freelancers or consultants who use your tool for their clients. Call Sales

Critical Considerations

The "Aha!" Moment: Ensure the user sees a "sneak peek" of the Build Pack's value before they pay. Show them a blurred version or a table of contents of what they are about to unlock.

Token Optimization: If your token cost is $10, you are likely using a high-end model (like GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for the whole process. Can you use a cheaper model for the "intro" steps and only "call in the big guns" once the user has paid?
