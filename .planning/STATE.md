## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.4 decisions archived. See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Known Technical Debt

- Next.js middleware → proxy convention migration (non-blocking)
- CRON_SECRET needs configuration in Vercel dashboard for production cron warming
- Step 10 Validate produces synthesis summary only (no Build Pack export yet - deferred to MMP)
- E2E back-navigation testing deferred (forward-only tested)
- Mobile grid optimization deferred
