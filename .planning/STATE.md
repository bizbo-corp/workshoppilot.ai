## Accumulated Context

- E2E back-navigation testing deferred
- Mobile grid optimization deferred
- /api/dev/seed-workshop build error (pre-existing)
- First-run onboarding tour deferred (ONBD-01/02/03 — being addressed in v1.8)
- PDF/PPT export deferred — v1.7 delivers Markdown + JSON only
- No re-generation after step updates — generates once on completion
