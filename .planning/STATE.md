# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-08)

**Core value:** Anyone with a vague idea can produce validated, AI-ready product specs without design thinking knowledge — the AI facilitator replaces the human facilitator.
**Current focus:** Phase 7 - Context Architecture (v1.0 milestone)

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 14 (Context Architecture)
Plan: 3 of 3 complete
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-02-08 — Completed 07-03-PLAN.md (Chat Integration)

Progress: [███████░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 50% (7 of 14 phases complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 22
- Average duration: 2.8 min
- Total execution time: 1.4 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation-database | 3 | 7 min | 2.3 min |
| 02-authentication-roles | 4 | 14 min | 3.5 min |
| 03-application-shell | 6 | 26 min | 4.3 min |
| 04-navigation-state | 2 | 4 min | 2.0 min |
| 05-ai-chat-integration | 2 | 9 min | 4.5 min |
| 06-production-deployment | 2 | 12 min | 6.0 min |
| 07-context-architecture | 3 | 6 min | 2.0 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- v0.5 milestone: 6 phases, 19 plans in 2 days
- Trend: Stable velocity, predictable execution

*Updated after v0.5 completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting v1.0 work:

- **Phase 7+**: Dual-layer context architecture (structured JSON + summaries) prevents context degradation after step 4-5
- **Phase 7+**: Hierarchical compression with 3 tiers (short-term verbatim, long-term summaries, persistent JSON) is architectural, can't retrofit
- **Phase 7 Plan 1**: JSONB storage for artifacts with placeholder Record<string, unknown> until Phase 9 adds Zod schemas
- **Phase 7 Plan 1**: Unique constraint on workshopStepId enforces one artifact/summary per workshop step
- **Phase 7 Plan 1**: Optimistic locking on step_artifacts via version column enables Phase 10 concurrent update detection
- **Phase 7 Plan 1**: schemaVersion column enables future artifact schema evolution without breaking old workshops
- **Phase 7 Plan 2**: Three separate queries for context assembly (efficient for small result sets, clearer than complex joins)
- **Phase 7 Plan 2**: Empty context tiers return empty strings (not placeholder text - don't waste tokens)
- **Phase 7 Plan 2**: AI summarization gracefully degrades (fallback message doesn't block step completion)
- **Phase 7 Plan 3**: Synchronous summary generation on step completion (reliability > speed for context propagation)
- **Phase 7 Plan 3**: Summary generation failure doesn't block step completion (logged error, step still marked complete)
- **Phase 7 Plan 3**: workshopId required in chat API for context assembly (breaking change for client)
- **Phase 8+**: Step-aware prompting with 6-phase arc (Orient → Gather → Synthesize → Refine → Validate → Complete)
- **Phase 9+**: Schema-driven extraction using Zod + AI SDK 6's streamText with output property
- **Phase 10+**: Auto-save with debounce (2s, maxWait 10s) + optimistic locking prevents race conditions
- **Phase 11-13**: Group steps into natural clusters (Discovery 1-4, Definition 5-7, Ideation/Validation 8-10)

### Pending Todos

- Workshops table needs deletedAt column for soft delete (from v0.5)
- Next.js middleware → proxy convention migration (non-blocking from v0.5)

### Blockers/Concerns

**From research (addressed in roadmap):**
- Context degradation syndrome: Solved by Phase 7 hierarchical context architecture
- Gemini rate limit cascade failures: Addressed in Phase 14 production hardening
- Neon cold start death spiral: Addressed in Phase 14 with health-check warming
- Auto-save race conditions: Prevented in Phase 10 with optimistic locking

**Current concerns:**
- Phase count is higher (8 phases vs typical 5-8) due to foundational complexity — acceptable for "standard" depth given v1.0's architectural requirements
- Steps 5-7 (Phase 12) and 8-10 (Phase 13) are grouped, may need refinement during planning if individual step complexity is high
- Production hardening (Phase 14) can't be tested meaningfully until features exist — may discover issues late

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-08 (Phase 7 completion)
Stopped at: Completed 07-03-PLAN.md (Chat Integration) — Phase 7 complete
Resume file: None

**Next action:** Begin Phase 8 (AI Facilitation - Step-Specific Prompts)
