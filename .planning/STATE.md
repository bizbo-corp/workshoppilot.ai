**Core value:** Anyone with a vague idea can produce validated, AI-ready product specs without design thinking knowledge — the AI facilitator replaces the human facilitator.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.4 decisions archived. See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Known Technical Debt

- Next.js middleware → proxy convention migration (non-blocking)
- CRON_SECRET needs configuration in Vercel dashboard for production cron warming
- Step 10 Validate produces synthesis summary only (outputs shell in v1.5, actual generation deferred to MMP)
- E2E back-navigation testing deferred (forward-only tested)
- Mobile grid optimization deferred
