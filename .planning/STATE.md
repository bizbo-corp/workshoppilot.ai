## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All prior decisions archived. See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

Recent v1.5 decisions:
- Theme rollout is about applying the EXISTING olive palette (tailwind config/global.css) — not designing a new one
- Pricing page is informational only, no payment processing; hidden from nav
- Step 10 outputs shell keeps existing synthesis summary, adds disabled download cards

### Pending Todos

None.

### Known Technical Debt

- Next.js middleware → proxy convention migration (non-blocking)
- CRON_SECRET needs configuration in Vercel dashboard for production cron warming
- E2E back-navigation testing deferred (forward-only tested)
- Mobile grid optimization deferred
